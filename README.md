# KNN-classifier
K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.

K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.

K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.

K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.

K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.

It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.

KNN algorithm at the training phase just stores the dataset and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much similar to the new data.



How does K-NN work?

The K-NN working can be explained on the basis of the below algorithm:


Step-1: Select the number K of the neighbors

Step-2: Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors

Step-3: Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.

Step-4: Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.

Step-5: Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.
